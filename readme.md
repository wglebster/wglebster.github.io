# Wglebster's homepage

I created this space to keep track of and showcase all my projects as I recall old coding stuff and learn new things.

For now I will be posing the projects I complete as part of my Full-Stack dev tutorial. 
I already have a few projects in mind. I will be working on these after completing the tutorial, so ***Stay Tuned!***

I will be using this readme as a log of how this website is being built. This should provide a nice insight into the agile development process - from an empty GitHub repo :construction_worker: > into an MVP :thumbsup:> then into a magical Unicorn :unicorn:
